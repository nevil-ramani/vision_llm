https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a08fc8d5-83b1-417c-9999-dcad8ef93485

A powerful desktop application built with Electron that enables real-time image analysis directly on your device through WebGPU acceleration. This application runs vision language models entirely client-side without requiring server dependencies.

## Features

- **100% Client-Side Processing**: All AI inference runs locally on your machine
- **GPU-Accelerated**: Utilizes WebGPU for high-performance model execution
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Process images with minimal latency
- **Multiple Vision Tasks**:
  - Image captioning
  - Optical character recognition (OCR)
  - Object detection
  - Region/segment analysis
  - Visual question answering
